A Remix of the Geoscape view music in UFO: enemy unknown for you X-COM fans out there :) 

I've always really liked the music in the x-com games so one day I decided to modernize this atmospheric piece of music. It should have all the themes that were in the original but I've shortened it a bit by cutting out the almost silent bits where nothing was happening. 

Hope you guys like it. :)
